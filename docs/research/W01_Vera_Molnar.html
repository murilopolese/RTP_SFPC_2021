<p>Born in Hungary in 1924, Vera Molnar is one of the first women artists to use computers in her practice. Trained as a traditional artist, she studied art history and aesthetics at the Budapest College of Fine Arts and moved to Paris in 1947, where she still lives.</p>
<p>She co-founded several pioneering artist research groups such as G.R.A.V. (Groupe de Recherche d&apos;Art Visuel), which investigate collaborative approaches to mechanical and kinetic art, and the research group for art and computer science at the Institute of Art and Science in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-dating the computer, she invented algorithms or &#x201C;machine imaginaire&#x201D; that allowed the creation of image series following a set of pre-ordained compositional rules.</strong> Beginning in 1968, the computer became a central device in the making of her paintings and drawings, allowing her to more comprehensively investigate endless variations in geometric shape and line.</p>
<p>Still active today at the young age of 95, she is the recipient of the first D.velop Digital Art Award (2005), was appointed Chevalier of Arts and Letters (2007), and won the outstanding merit award AWARE in 2018. (<a href="http://veramolnar.com" target="_blank">veramolnar.com</a>)</p>
<p>Molnar believes one power of the computer is that the random can create an <a href="https://monoskop.org/Vera_Moln%C3%A1r" target="_blank">aesthetic shock</a> that ruptures the systematic and symmetrical. The rigor and meticulousness which she applies to her logics, is the human bias that computation and randomness cannot create alone. The work is so powerful because the &#x201C;randomness&#x201D; exists within Molnar&#x2019;s bias.</p>
<p>Molnar is a wonderful example of how the computer can be a powerful tool in the right hands. Her precise, sensitive modulations of placement and angles take minimalist ingredients and create a complex feast for the eyes.
In 1968, she became one of the pioneers of computer use in artistic creation, a tool that, in her words, allowed her art to &#x201C;free itself from a classical heritage sclerotic&#x201D; while enabling her to maintain full control of her compositions. Vera Molnar today enriches an already renowned body of work with new systematic constructions in bright colors.</p>
<p>Moma: Vera Moln&#xE1;r (born 1924) is a French media artist of Hungarian origin. Molnar is widely considered to be a pioneer of computer art and generative art, and is also one of the first women to use computers in her art practice.Born in Hungary, she studied aesthetics and art history at the Budapest College of Fine Arts. In the 1940s and 50s, she created non-representational paintings. By 1959 she was making combinatorial images; in 1968 she would use a computer to create her first algorithmic drawings. In the 1960s she founded two groups in France concerned with the use of technology within the arts: the Groupe de Recherche d&#x2019;Art Visuel and Art et Informatique. Her work has been widely collected by major museums; in 2007 she was named a Chevalier of Arts and Letters in France.</p>

<p>Started painting at the age of twelve, her first subject matter, nymphs and trees, inspired by an uncle. Soon progressed to more geometrical themes, and in <a href="https://monoskop.org/index.php?title=1968&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" target="_blank">1968</a> started working with computers. Her work during this period focused on the breakup of repeating units, often expressed as a series of increasingly fractured images. In order to do away with what she calls &quot;mental-cultural ready-mades,&quot; she employs different programmatic games and mathematical principles in order to produce series of work guided by a unifying quest for the invisible.</p>
<p>Vera Molnar holds that the computer can serve four purposes. The first concerns its technical promise---it widens the area of the possible with its infinite array of forms and colors, and particularly with the development of virtual space. Secondly, the computer can satisfy the desire for artistic innovations and thus lighten the burden of traditional cultural forms. It can make the accidental or random subversive in order to create an aesthetic shock and to rupture the systematic and the symmetrical. For this purpose a virtual data bank can be assembled. Thirdly, the computer can encourage the mind to work in new ways. Molnar believes that artists often pass far too quickly from the idea to the realization of the work. The computer can create images that can be stored for longer, not only in the data bank but also in the artist&apos;s imagination. Finally, Molnar thinks that the computer can help the artist by measuring the physiological reactions of the audience, their eye movements for example, thus bringing the creative process into closer accordance with its products and their effects. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060702154625/http://mitpress2.mit.edu/e-journals/Leonardo/isast/articles/popper.html" target="_blank">(Source)</a></p>

<ul>
<li>&#x201C;I imagined I had a computer. I created a program and then, step by step, realized simple, limited series, which, though, were self-contained, thus not skipping any shape combination.&#x201D;</li>
<li>&#x201C;It&apos;s a paradox, but the people who argued at the beginning that using computers dehumanizes art... the opposite is true. Because it&apos;s thanks to all this technology that we can get very close to what we have imagined that we might not have found otherwise.&#x201D; (Vera Molnar: Randomness <a href="https://vimeo.com/372579247" target="_blank">https://vimeo.com/372579247</a>)</li>
<li>&#x201C;I am a painter, an image-maker, in particular, of images of a nonfigurative kind. I &apos;create&apos; visual forms in the sense that they consist of combinations of shapes that cannot be found in nature.&#x201D;</li>

<p>What books inspired them?
&#x201C;When a few years ago, Vera Molnar bought a small notebook whose pages were each divided into four strips, Raymond Queneau&apos;s opus, <em>One hundred thousand billion poems</em>, may have come to mind. But Vera Molnar set her own rules here. With a gouache pen, using four different colours and four different thicknesses she drew, on about a  hundred pages, outlines of Mount Sainte-Victoire so dear to C&#xE9;zanne&apos;s heart.&#x201D; (<a href="https://www.bernardchauveau.com/en/artists-books/230-vera-molnar-six-million-seven-hundred-and-sixty-five-thousand-and-two-hundred-and-one-sainte-victoire-9782363060617.html" target="_blank">https://www.bernardchauveau.com/en/artists-books/230-vera-molnar-six-million-seven-hundred-and-sixty-five-thousand-and-two-hundred-and-one-sainte-victoire-9782363060617.html</a>)</p>
