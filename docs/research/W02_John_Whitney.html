<p><strong>Biographic data</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.5/2.5images/moritzwhitney01.gif" alt="Digital Harmony: The Life of John Whitney, Computer Animation Pioneer"></p>
<p>John Whitney, Sr. was an U.S.American animation film maker, composer and inventor, popularly recognized as one of the fathers of computer animation.</p>
<p>From his first work with 8 mm film of a solar eclipse recorded with a home-made telescope, to the early innovative experiments with computer graphic systems, John Whitney Sr. has developed and deployed technology for artistic usage.</p>
<p>He was assisted by his family members in many projects which linked musical composition with experimental film and computer imaging. Since his recognized works in the first International Experimental Film Competition in Belgium, 1949, to his masterpiece Arabesque in 1975, John Whitney remained a true pioneer until his death in 1996.

<p><strong>Harmonic Progression</strong>
In each of John&apos;s next five films [<em>Permutations</em> (1968), <em>Osaka 1-2-3</em> (1971), <em>Matrix I</em> (1971), <em>Matrix II</em> (1971), <em>Matrix III</em> (1972), <em>Arabesque</em> (1975)], <em>*he demonstrated the principle of &quot;harmonic progression.&quot; For example, in </em>Arabesque<em> (programmed by Larry Cuba), Whitney experimented with the eccentricities of Islamic architecture, which, though ultimately harmonic, contain many characteristic reverse curves in its embellishments. Whitney also made three documentary films on the subject of digital harmony. In 1979 he completed </em>Experiments in Motion Graphics<em>. His 1973 </em>Hex Demo<em> for a lecture at Cranbrook was included on a laserdisc of his works issued by Pioneer in 1984.He also completed in 1993 </em>A Personal Search for the Complementarity of Music and Visual Art* which is available through Pyramid Film and Video.</p>

<li>With his computerized motion-control set-up, Whitney could produce a variety of innovative designs and metamorphoses of text and still images, which proved very successful in advertising and titling of commercial projects. By 1960 Whitney prepared a sample reel of these and other effects he could produce, and solicited work for his Motion Graphics, Inc. company. This company kept him so busy he did not have time to make personal films using the computerized motion-control set-up. His sample reel was artfully edited and ended with a lovely final image of a lissajous curve multiplied dozens of times, to appear twisting in waves, suggesting the time-lapse of a blossoming flower. The reel was released as <em>Catalog</em> and became a popular classic of 1960&apos;s psychedelica. <a href="https://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.5/2.5pages/2.5moritzwhitney.html" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.5/2.5pages/2.5moritzwhitney.html" target="_blank">(Source)</a></li>

<p>In the early 1960&#x2019;s he built an analog computer from anti-missile detectors designed during WWII.
A visualization of the results obtained by this complex mechanism resembles somehow the workings of a <a href="https://href.li/?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph" target="_blank">spirograph</a>. This is noticeable in the first collection of experiments made by Whitney and his machine, published in 1961 in the form of a promotional reel titled &#x201C;catalog&#x201D;.</p>

<p>&#x201C;People writing about music for at least a century have been referring to music as the &#x2018;engulfed cathedral&#x2018;, a kind of architecture; unfrozen or fluid architecture. Likewise, that&apos;s the same architecture we&apos;re gonna see [with computer generated animation], it&apos;s just no doubt it&apos;s visible &#x2014; it can be made visible.&#x201D;</p>
